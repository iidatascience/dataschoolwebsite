<p><img src="img/sentiment11.png" alt="Data Science" title="Data Science" />Advancements in storage technology, networking, and analysis platforms make it possible to store and analyze large amounts of data in real time.  The opportunity to store large amounts has improved the ability of decision making, prediction, and forecasting.  Distributed and parallel computing has also increased the capabilities of data science technologies.</p>

<p><img src="img/sentiment12.png" alt="Data Science" title="Data Science" />One area that data science is providing advances is in healthcare.  The growing volume of health care data provides a resource for improving medicine.  Health care research can be improved by new techniques that data science makes available.</p>

<p><img src="img/sentiment8.png" alt="Data Science" title="Data Science" />Big data analysis offers new opportunities for analyzing large amounts of data.  Data can be converted from various structured and unstructured formats.  Data can also be mined from existing data warehouses.</p>

<p>Topics in data science include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Machine Learning</li>
	<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
	<li>Neural Networks</li>
</ul>

<p>Analytics platforms for data science have the capabilities of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Wokflow distribution - The ability to develop and manage repeatable workflows</li>
	<li>Machine learning - Training algorithms to represent systems</li>
	<li>Planning - Prediction and forecasting based on historical data</li>
</ul>

<p>Data can be collected from a variety of sources.  Data can be combined through data processing frameworks and with databases.  Querying languages make it possible to retrieve data from structured sources.</p>

<p>From a theory, an analysis can be created through iterative cycles.  The theory can be validated or disputed by the results of an analysis.  Stages for data science include collecting data, confirming data, analysing data, and reporting results.</p>
	
<p>The design of data science research involves choosing from various approaches with different perspectives.  Risks and funding are also to be considered in the design of the research.  The motivating factors of the research guide the requirements.</p>


<p>The requirements of data science research derive principles and parameters for the research innovation.  The process of developing the requirements allows the researcher for a clear and consistent foundation for the research.</p>
